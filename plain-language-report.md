## Our Editing Work: Micro- and Macro-Level Content Organization

For the content organization component of our project, we first focused on editing and revising our content to match the professor's critiques. Several major points of revision were included in [the professor's feedback PR](https://github.com/ENG517/DITA-TM-3/pull/12#issue-3643614452), including improvements to our XML formatting and instructions, a request for filtering conditions to mark our novice and expert content, and some general suggestions like making our image paths relative and reordering content in some of our task files. Along with implementing the filtering conditions and fixing our links and filepaths, we made sure to revise our actual content and structure to be more reuseable, active, and consistent, and to improve the quality of our header titles and short descriptions. 

One specific example of a major revision we included is the concluding paragraph of our "replacing router" task topic. Initially, it looked like this: 

"Congratulations, you've successfully replaced your old Synology WRX560 router with a new one! If you need a quick refresher on the installation process, feel free to check out our user guide on the procedure. You can also visit <xref scope="external" href="https://kb.synology.com/en-us/SRM">Synology's official website</xref> if you have any questions!" 

In his feedback, the professor pointed out that this needed a result condition so users would know if they completed the task successfully. In [the PR for our 
"changes-based-on-feedback" branch](https://github.com/ENG517/DITA-TM-3/pull/13#issue-3677196944), we revised the excerpt to include a clear result condition so that users would be able to check that they correctly replaced their Wi-Fi router: 

"After completing the software set-up, try connecting one of your devices to the new network and accessing the internet. If your device connects and the internet connection is stable, then congratulations! You've successfully replaced your old Synology WRX560 router with a new one. If you need a quick refresher on the installation process, feel free to check out the user guide. You can also visit <xref scope="external" href="https://kb.synology.com/en-us/SRM">Synology's official website</xref> if you have any questions!" 

By taking on these revisions and editing our copy to be more concise and helpful, we were able to improve upon our pre-existing work and better incorporate the concepts we learned throughout the semester about topics, audience types, and usability. 

## Our Document Design Work: Typography and Style Guide

For the document design portion of the project, our efforts were mainly focused on design/redesign. We spent some time carefully considering each typography aspect (font type, font size, line spacing, color, headers, etc). For font types, we made changes and settled on three main fonts to use: Fira Sans, Oswald, and Hind Vadodara; we considered things like serif vs sans-serif, readability/accessibility, and whether the style/tone the font carried felt like a good fit for our project theme. We also ended up choosing to adjust the font size to be larger for further readability, and we used a color generator to come up with color pairings for our primary, secondary and accent colors in the document. We made the primary blues more dark and metallic/gray, chose greens instead of reds for the secondary colors, and made our accents a deeper yellow, all of which is reflected in our [Style Guide Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KEPlBnFCgDeKWJJi726VrBCxS3rcNm5dMk1doLYuWzU/edit?usp=sharing). While design and style preferences are often subjective, our team strived to make document design choices that were objectively readable, visually appealing, and compatible with the theme/subject of our project.
